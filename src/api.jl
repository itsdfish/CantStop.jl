    select_runners(Game::AbstractGame, player::AbstractPlayer, options)

During the selection phase, select runners based on the outcome of a dice roll. 

# Arguments

- `game::AbstractGame`: an abstract game object for Can't Stop. The object can be modified if `is_safe=false` is set 
    in `simulate!`.
- `player::AbstractPlayer`: an subtype of a abstract player
- `options`: a vector of runners which can advance. For example, if the roll is `[1,1,2,2]` and runners can be used in columns 2,3, and 4, then the options would be `[[2,4],[3,3]]`.
    If a runner cannot be moved in column 2, then the options would be `[[4],[3,3]]`.

# Returns 

- `c_idx::Vector{Int}`: a vector of selected column indices for moving runner
